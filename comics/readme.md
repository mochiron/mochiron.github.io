#Project Details

Need to make a template (maybe with Jekyll?) to read from directory and create either:
a) A json file with the list of comics (better. This can be done as part of a webpack, grunt ro gulp task)
b) Read the directory structure with server side js or similar

Regardless, we need a js to read the json structure and display it with a dropdown with prev and next.

Add robots, metas and sitemap as well as analytics.

Link it (share with?) tumblr.

Need to have a layout and just focus on creating the comic in html
